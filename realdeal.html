<div class="question" id="q1"> <p> You are Alexander Hamilton. It is the winters ball. There are ladies spread around, mingling with the other gentalmen. You see one lady coming directly towards you. She finally reaches you and introduces herself, "Hello, I am Angelica Schulyer." The name rings in your mind. Finally, you remmeber hearing it before from your buddies when they were telling you "the only way you can get rich is to marry a Schulyer sister." She coughs. You realize she was asking you a question. "I said, and you are?" Oh no! Do you lie and tell her you are a rich lord who would make a great husband, or charm your way around the question?</p>
<button class="choiceleft" id="c1"> LIE </button> 
<button class="choiceright" id="c2"> CHARM </button> </div>

<div class="gameover" id="over1"> <p> How dare you lie to Angelica Schuyler, of all people? She kicks you out, after realizing you obviously lied. You will never make a destiny for your self now. </p>
<a id="start" class="button" href="explore.html">start again? </a></div>

<div class="question" id="q2"> <p> Angelica blushes. Wow, you did it again, Alexander. How are you going to keep the ladies off of you? You think to yourself while Angelica directs you towards her sister. Um, did she just reject me? How can that be? You look towards her sister. She is obviosly in awe of your presense, as she practically drools over your hotness. "This is my sister, Eliza. I think you two will really hit it off." Angelica states as she starts to walk off. Do you grab her hand and ignore her sister, or settle with Eliza instead?</p>
<button class="choiceleft" id="c3"> ANGELICA </button> 
<button class="choiceright" class= "eliza" id="c4"> ELIZA </button> </div>

<div class="question" id="q3"> 
	<p> You grab onto Angelica's arm, turning to see Eliza's devastated look on her face. Angelica pulls you a aside, "Playa, you think this is a choice. Do I need to spell it out for you? I REGECTED YOU. Now go, marry my sister and live a happy life. You will never be satisfied, but at least you can try.
	</p>
		<button class="choiceleft" class="eliza" id="c5"> GO BACK TO ELIZA AND ASK FOR HER FORGIVNESS 
		</button> 
 </div>
 <div class="question" id="q4"> 
 	<p> You can see the happiness in Eliza's eyes as you gesture towards her. You can't help but notice the saddness at Angelica attempts to hide but fails. You're the one who regected me, come on woman, get a grip, you think to yourself as you walk off with Eliza into your new life together. The weeks pass by, and suddenly, you are getting married. Even though Eliza is loaded, you still do not have enough money to maintain a rich lifstyle, due to your lack of funds. You move into to a cute little house on the side of a hill.

</div>

<div class="question washwash"  id="q5"> 
	<p> You are lounging around in the cozy living room that you and Eliza furnished yourself when someone taps on your shoulder. The tapper hands you a letter. After skimming over the whole letter to get to the exciting parts, you realize this is a letter from the General of the army against the Bristish, Grorge Washinton. He has heard about your work at King's College and want's to meet you in person to discuss your future in goverment. Filled with excitiment, you wonder wether or not it is a good idea to go and meet him.

<div class="gaveover"  id="over2"> 
	<p> really? you think you are too cool to go talk to the future president of your country? pathetic. you will never have a legacy now. 
	</p>
		<a id="start" class="button" href="explore.html">start again? </a>
</div>
<div class="question"  id="q7"> 
	<p> You suddenly find yourself in a fancy looking office. Washinton stands in front of you, staring deeply into your eyes, anaylsing your every word. You start to wonder, why did he bring me here? I'm just a bastard, orphan, who's mother deserted him and was forced to fight for any type of education. Oh wait, that why. I've fought for everything I have, why wouldn't he want me on his squad. After you stop spacing out, you realize Washington has just offered you a job. As his assitant officers, but you wouldn't fight. You battle with this decision in your mind. Your whole life you have wanted to fight for your rights as a country, but what if writing is the best way to use your education? You pause, thinking before awnsering his question. 
	</p>
		<button class="choiceleft" id="c9"> REFUSE AND FIGHT </button> 
		<button class="choiceright" id="c10"> ACCEPT AND WRITE </button> 
</div>
<div class="gameover"  id="over3"> 
	<p> Washington is disapointed, but he respects your decision. you fight in the front line. you die after three days of hardcore fighting. your legacy is later on seen as just another soldiger who died in battle. 
	</p>
		<a id="start" class="button" href="explore.html">start again? </a>
</div>
<div class="question"  id="q8"> 
	<p> "Good choice", Washington states as you agree with him and become his right hand man (buaw bauw bauw). 
	</p>
		<button class="choiceleft" id="c11"> CONTINUE </button> 
</div>
<div class="question"  id="q9"> 
	<p> FLASHFORWARD. The war is won. The colonies have finally gained independence for Britain, but the fight is not over. The fighting opinions of the many goverment officials change the constituation. You are a strong Fedaralist leader and have decided to right a series of essays, anmouysly published, defending the document (the Constitution) to the public. This is an increbily risky move, but you want the best men to be righting along with you. This takes you to Burr. You and Aaron Burr have never liked each other, or agreeded on anything while you two were working in the same building. You are mortal enemies, but you know he is a better lawyer than you. YOu see him the hallway in front of you. 
	</p>
		<button class="choiceleft" id="c12"> WALK TOWARDS HIM </button> 
</div>
<div class="question"  id="q10"> 
	<p> Burr refuses and yells at you claiming that you have a death wish, "What if you're supporting the wrong side?" He brings up a good point. What happens if your legacy is shut down by a simple action of being on the wrong side of history? As Washington always says, "History has it's eyes on you." Do you really want to risk everything for the good of your country?
	</p>
		<button class="choiceleft" id="c13"> WRITE THE PAPERS </button> 
		<button class="choiceleft" id="c14"> AGREE W BURR </button> 
</div>
<div class="gameover"  id="over4"> 
	<p> You don't right fedarlist papers, James Madison and John Jay write a total of 31 essays and are known as the men who failed their country. Don't laugh you little ragtag. You're legacy is lost in your lack of confidence.
