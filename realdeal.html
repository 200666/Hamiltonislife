<div class="question" id="q1"> <p> You are Alexander Hamilton. It is the winters ball. There are ladies spread around, mingling with the other gentalmen. You see one lady coming directly towards you. She finally reaches you and introduces herself, "Hello, I am Angelica Schulyer." The name rings in your mind. Finally, you remmeber hearing it before from your buddies when they were telling you "the only way you can get rich is to marry a Schulyer sister." She coughs. You realize she was asking you a question. "I said, and you are?" Oh no! Do you lie and tell her you are a rich lord who would make a great husband, or charm your way around the question?</p>
<button class="choiceleft" id="c1"> LIE </button> 
<button class="choiceright" id="c2"> CHARM </button> </div>

<div class="gameover" id="over1"> <p> How dare you lie to Angelica Schuyler, of all people? She kicks you out, after realizing you obviously lied. You will never make a destiny for your self now. </p>
<a id="start" class="button" href="explore.html">start again? </a></div>

<div class="question" id="q2"> <p> Angelica blushes. Wow, you did it again, Alexander. How are you going to keep the ladies off of you? You think to yourself while Angelica directs you towards her sister. Um, did she just reject me? How can that be? You look towards her sister. She is obviosly in awe of your presense, as she practically drools over your hotness. "This is my sister, Eliza. I think you two will really hit it off." Angelica states as she starts to walk off. Do you grab her hand and ignore her sister, or settle with Eliza instead?</p>
<button class="choiceleft" id="c3"> ANGELICA </button> 
<button class="choiceright" id="c4"> ELIZA </button> </div>

<div class="question" id="q3"> <p> You grab onto Angelica's arm, turning to see Eliza's devastated look on her face. Angelica pulls you a aside, "Player, you think this is a choice. Do I need to spell it out for you? I REGECTED YOU. Now go, marry my sister and live a happy life. You will never be satisfied, but at least you can try. </p>
<button class="choiceleft" id="c5"> GO BACK TO ELIZA AND ASK FOR HER FORGIVNESS </button>
