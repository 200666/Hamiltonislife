<div class="question" id="q2"> <p> Angelica blushes. Wow, you did it again, Alexander. How are you going to keep the ladies off of you? You think to yourself while Angelica directs you towards her sister. Um, did she just reject me? How can that be? You look towards her sister. She is obviosly in awe of your presense, as she practically drools over your hotness. "This is my sister, Eliza. I think you two will really hit it off." Angelica states as she starts to walk off. Do you grab her hand and ignore her sister, or settle with Eliza instead?</p>

<div class="question" id="q3"> 
	<p> You grab onto Angelica's arm, turning to see Eliza's devastated look on her face. Angelica pulls you a aside, "Playa, you think this is a choice. Do I need to spell it out for you? I REGECTED YOU. Now go, marry my sister and live a happy life. You will never be satisfied, but at least you can try.

You're the one who regected me, come on woman, get a grip, you think to yourself as you walk off with Eliza into your new life together. The weeks pass by, and suddenly, you are getting married. Even though Eliza is loaded, you still do not have enough money to maintain a rich lifstyle, due to your lack of funds. You move into to a cute little house on the side of a hill.

After skimming over the whole letter to get to the exciting parts, you realize this is a letter from the General of the army against the Bristish, Grorge Washinton. He has heard about your work at King's College and want's to meet you in person to discuss your future in goverment. Filled with excitiment, you wonder wether or not it is a good idea to go and meet him.

	<p> You suddenly find yourself in a fancy looking office. Washinton stands in front of you, staring deeply into your eyes, anaylsing your every word. You start to wonder, why did he bring me here? I'm just a bastard, orphan, who's mother deserted him and was forced to fight for any type of education. Oh wait, that why. I've fought for everything I have, why wouldn't he want me on his squad. After you stop spacing out, you realize Washington has just offered you a job. As his assitant officers, but you wouldn't fight. You battle with this decision in your mind. Your whole life you have wanted to fight for your rights as a country, but what if writing is the best way to use your education? You pause, thinking before awnsering his question.

<div class="question"  id="q9"> 
	<p> FLASHFORWARD. The war is won. The colonies have finally gained independence for Britain, but the fight is not over. The fighting opinions of the many goverment officials change the constituation. You are a strong Fedaralist leader and have decided to right a series of essays, anmouysly published, defending the document (the Constitution) to the public. This is an increbily risky move, but you want the best men to be righting along with you. This takes you to Burr. You and Aaron Burr have never liked each other, or agreeded on anything while you two were working in the same building. You are mortal enemies, but you know he is a better lawyer than you. YOu see him the hallway in front of you.

<div class="question"  id="q10"> 
	<p> Burr refuses and yells at you claiming that you have a death wish, "What if you're supporting the wrong side?" He brings up a good point. What happens if your legacy is shut down by a simple action of being on the wrong side of history? As Washington always says, "History has it's eyes on you." Do you really want to risk everything for the good of your country?

"Darling,"" you ask, "what is wrong?" "I have something to tell you, my love." she looks at the ground. "What is it?" "I am pregnant." Oh shot. You knew that after fighting for a long time you would have to return some time, but to a child. You have never even considered children as a focal point of your life achievments. Do you stay with the child or continue your legacy in goverment.
